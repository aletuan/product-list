## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- npm (>= 6.x) or yarn (>= 1.x)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-list.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
   npm install 
    ```

3. Install the dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test` or `yarn test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

`npm run build` or `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

`npm run eject` or `yarn eject`
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
